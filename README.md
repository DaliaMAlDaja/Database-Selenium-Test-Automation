# Database-Selenium-Test-Automation

This is a test automation project built using **Java**, **Selenium WebDriver**, **MySQL**, and **TestNG**.  
It demonstrates how to perform **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a database and use that data to fill a web form automatically.

## 🚀 Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Connect to a **MySQL** database
- Perform database operations: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `READ`, and `DELETE`
- Use **Selenium WebDriver** to open a web browser and fill a registration form using data from the database
- Confirm deletion of the data after automation is complete

This is a test project for learning purposes.
